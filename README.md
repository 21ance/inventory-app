# Inventory App

**About this application:**
Hello, this is my first project trying out Node/Express and MongoDB/Mongoose. I did it as part of the [NodeJS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-inventory-application) in The Odin Project. The project is not perfect as I myself have noticed that there are inefficiencies in how I used Pug templating and MongoDB database calls. As I have already spent quite a bit of time doing this project, I will move to the next one and try my best to improve on these inefficiencies.

I have attached project information and screenshots below. Thank you for reading.
